### Module 3


### Visualising Data

##### In this module you will be introduced to fundamental principles behind effective data visualisation. Through the use of grammar of graphics plotting concepts implemented in the [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html) package, you will be able create meaningful exploratory plots. You will develop understanding about the way in which you should be able to think about necessary data transformations and summaries that can lead to an informative visualisation. You will learn how to create static maps and interactive maps with geolocated data by using the most popular packages in the R GIS community: [simple features](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/index.html) and [leaflet](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/leaflet/index.html).

#### What you will learn:

* Basic principles of effective data visualisation
* to specify [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html) building blocks and combine them to create graphical display
* about the philosophy that guides [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html): grammatical elements (layers) and aesthetic mappings.
* visualising data with maps
