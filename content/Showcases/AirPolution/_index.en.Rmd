```

This is a data analysis report about air pollution in Belgrade with an explanation of the R code used. Data that will be used for the analysis comes from the stations, which are set up by an independent initiative [Vazduh Gradjanima](https://vazduhgradjanima.rs).

---

**Reading and organising data**

We will start the analysis by uploading the necessary packages and data into R.

If you have not got the packages used in the following code, you will need to uncomment the first few lines (delete the `#` symbol) in the code below.

```{r}
#install.packages("rmarkdown")
#install.packages("leaflet")
#install.packages("lubridate")
#install.packages("dplyr")
#install.packages("tidyverse")
#install.packages("DT")
library(leaflet)
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(lubridate))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
# read data
mydata <- read.csv('https://vazduhgradjanima.rs/files/data.csv', 
                    header=T, 
                    na.strings=c("","NA"),
                    stringsAsFactor = FALSE) 
```

It is always a good idea to have a look at data you upload, before you start using it for your analysis.
```{r}
# scan data
glimpse(mydata)
```

We can do some tweaking, by removing a few variables and separating day from time and creating separate columns for latitude and longitude variables.
```{r}
## remove 2nd and the last column
mydata <- mydata[, -c(2, 11)]
# separate date from time
mydata <- separate(mydata, timestamp, c("date", "time"), sep = "T")
## remove the last character from the `time` variable
mydata$time <- (str_sub(mydata$time, end = -2))
## separate lat and long
mydata <- separate(mydata, location , c("lat", "lng"), sep =",")
# scan data
glimpse(mydata)
```

We will check how many unique records each variable in our data has.
```{r}
(uniq <- unlist(lapply(mydata, function(x) length(unique(x)))))
```
To us it is most interesting to notice that we have `uniq[[3]] = 26` stations in total. Next, we'll check if all of the stations are active, by examining the number of readings for each station.

```{r}
# how many reading each station makes
mydata %>%
  group_by(device_title) %>%
  summarise(no_readings = n()) %>%
  arrange(no_readings) %>% 
  DT::datatable()
```

There are a couple of stations with only one or two readings. We will remove those stations form the data set and focus in our study only on the active stations. 

```{r}
# remove the inactive stations with only one or two readings using `filter()`
mydata_new <- mydata %>%
  filter(!device_title %in% c("Descon Klimerko Uciteljsko Naselje", "Descon Klimerko Rex")) 
```

---

**Mapping the stations**

To see where the stations are allocated we will plot them on Google maps. We will use the `leaflet` package to do this and create a sub data with only a list of the stations and their positions.

```{r}
# creating a dataframe with only names and lat & lng for each station
stations <- data.frame(lapply(mydata_new[,c(3:5)], function(x) unique(x))) %>% 
            drop_na()
# convert factor data type into numeric
stations [, 2] <- as.numeric(as.character(stations[,2]))
stations [, 3] <- as.numeric(as.character(stations[,3]))
summary(stations)
```
Once we have the subset data we can plot it using the `leaflet` package as below.

```{r}
library(leaflet)

minlat <- min(stations$lat)
maxlat <- max(stations$lat)
minlng <- min(stations$lng)
maxlng <- max(stations$lng)

stations %>% 
  group_by(device_title, lat, lng) %>% 
  leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>%
  fitBounds(~minlng, ~minlat, ~maxlng, ~maxlat) %>% 
  addCircles(lng = ~lng, lat = ~lat,
             radius = 150, weight = 5, color = "black",
             fillColor = "red", fillOpacity = 0.7,  
             popup = ~paste("<b>", device_title)
  ) 
```
Notice that there are a few stations outside of Belgrade. By clicking on their location points on the map, we can identify them and remove them from our data set, as we want to focus only on Belgrade's stations.

```{r}
mydata_bg <- mydata %>%
  filter(!device_title %in% c("Milovanovića Klimerko", "Descon Klimerko", "Descon Klimerko Smederevo")) 
```
Once removed, we will create a new map, by again creating sub dataframe with only stations we want to use in the analysis.

```{r}
# creating a dataframe with only names and lat & lng for each station
stations <- data.frame(lapply(mydata_bg[,c(3:5)], function(x) unique(x))) %>% 
  drop_na()
# convert factor data type into numeric
stations [, 2] <- as.numeric(as.character(stations[,2]))
stations [, 3] <- as.numeric(as.character(stations[,3]))
summary(stations)

# mapping the stations
minlat <- min(stations$lat)
maxlat <- max(stations$lat)
minlng <- min(stations$lng)
maxlng <- max(stations$lng)

stations %>% 
  group_by(device_title, lat, lng) %>% 
  leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>%
  fitBounds(~minlng, ~minlat, ~maxlng, ~maxlat) %>% 
  addCircles(lng = ~lng, lat = ~lat,
             radius = 150, weight = 5, color = "black",
             fillColor = "red", fillOpacity = 0.7,  
             popup = ~paste("<b>", device_title)) 
```

**Analysing the readings**

In this section we will look through the readings and try to make some sense of it all.
If you are not familiar with the information collected by the stations, ie. about the pm particles you can check the following link:  <https://www.irceline.be/en/documentation/faq/what-is-pm10-and-pm2.5>.

**Number of readings per week days**

The next chunk of code counts the number of readings per each week day, it shows it in a table and visualises it using the `ggplot2()` package.

```{r}
mydata_bg %>% 
  mutate(wday = wday(date, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(wday) %>% 
  summarise(no_readings = n()) %>% 
  DT::datatable()

mydata_bg %>% 
  mutate(wday = wday(date, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = wday, fill = wday)) +
  geom_bar(color = "black") +
  xlab("week days readings") + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") 
```

**Average concentration of particles each week day**

```{r}
# mean pm2.5 per week day
mydata_bg %>% 
  mutate(wday = wday(date, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(wday) %>% 
  summarise(mean_pm2.5 = mean(pm2.5, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = wday, y = mean_pm2.5, fill = wday)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", color = "black") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, vjust = 2, hjust=0.5)) +
  labs (title = "average value of pm2.5 per week days", 
        caption = "Data from: https://vazduhgradjanima.rs", 
        x = "week days", y = "average pm2.5") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Accent") + 
  theme(legend.position="none")


# mean pm10 per week day
mydata_bg %>% 
  mutate(wday = wday(date, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(wday) %>% 
  summarise(mean_pm10 = mean(pm10, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = wday, y = mean_pm10, fill = wday)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", color = "black") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, vjust = 2, hjust=0.5)) +
  labs (title = "average value of pm10 per week days", 
        caption = "Data from: https://vazduhgradjanima.rs", 
        x = "week days", y = "average pm10") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Accent") + 
  theme(legend.position="none") 
```
The previous two plots look very similar. It would be interesting to see the bars of the two plots next to each other.
```{r}
mydata_new %>% 
  mutate(wday = wday(date, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(wday) %>% 
  summarise(mean_pm2.5 = mean(pm2.5, na.rm = TRUE), mean_pm10 = mean(pm10, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  gather("pm_no", "mean_pm", -wday, factor_key = TRUE) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = wday, y = mean_pm, fill = pm_no )) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position = "dodge", color = "black") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, vjust = 2, hjust=0.5)) +
  labs (title = "average value of pm2.5 and pm10 per week days", 
        caption = "Data from: https://vazduhgradjanima.rs", 
        x = "week days", y = "average pm") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Set1") + 
  theme(legend.position="bottom") 
```

**Average concentration of particles each month**

```{r}
mydata_bg %>% 
  mutate(mon = month(date, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(mon) %>% 
  summarise(no_readings = n()) %>% 
  DT::datatable()
```
It would be better to have January showing after December, so we will reorder them.

```{r}
# order monts Oct-Jan
mydata_bg %>% 
    mutate(mon = month(date, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE)) %>% 
    mutate(mon = factor(mon, levels=c("Oct", "Nov", "Dec", "Jan"))) %>%
    group_by(mon) %>% 
    summarise(no_readings = n()) %>% 
  DT::datatable()
```

```{r}
mydata_bg %>% 
  mutate(mon = month(date, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(mon = factor(mon, levels=c("Oct", "Nov", "Dec", "Jan"))) %>%
  group_by(mon) %>% 
  summarise(mean_pm2.5 = mean(pm2.5, na.rm = TRUE), mean_pm10 = mean(pm10, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  gather("pm_no", "mean_pm", -mon, factor_key = TRUE) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = mon, y = mean_pm, fill = pm_no )) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position = "dodge", color = "black") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, vjust = 2, hjust=0.5)) +
  labs (title = "average value of pm2.5 and pm10 per month", 
        caption = "Data from: https://vazduhgradjanima.rs", 
        x = "month", y = "average pm") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Paired") + 
  theme(legend.position="bottom") 
```

**Average concentration of particles each hour**
```{r}
mydata_bg %>% 
  group_by(time) %>% 
  summarise(no_readings = n()) %>% 
  DT::datatable()

mydata_bg %>% 
  group_by(time) %>%
  summarise(mean_pm2.5 = mean(pm2.5, na.rm = TRUE), mean_pm10 = mean(pm10, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  gather("pm_no", "mean_pm", -time, factor_key = TRUE) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = mean_pm, fill = pm_no )) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position = "dodge", color = "black") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, vjust = 2, hjust=0.5)) +
  labs (title = "average value of pm2.5 and pm10 per hour", 
        caption = "Data from: https://vazduhgradjanima.rs", 
        x = "month", y = "average pm") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Paired") + 
  theme(legend.position="bottom") 
```

**Pressure and Humidity vs pm10**

In this section we will try to investigate if the concentration of pm particles depens upon other factors such as pressure and humidity.

**pm10 vs pressure**

To investigate the relationship between air pressure and concentration of pm10 particles we will create a scatterplot:

```{r}
mydata_bg %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = pressure, y = pm10)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2, shape = 20, col = "steelblue", size = 2) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F, col = "maroon3") + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = F, col = "limegreen") + 
  xlim(c(960, 1030)) + 
  ylim(c(0, 500)) +
  # give a title an label axes
  labs(title = "Pressure vs. pm10", 
       x = "pressure", y = "pm10.") + 
  
  # modify the appearance
  theme(legend.position = "none", 
        panel.border = element_rect(fill = NA, 
                                    colour = "black",
                                    size = .75),
        plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5)) 
```

The data is quite messy, with a number of very extreme readings, which is why we “chopped” the axis using the `xlim()` and the `ylim()` functions after checking the distributions of the two variables. This is a part of informal investigation of the possible relationship between `pm10` and `pressure`, and a more rigorous procedure should be adopted which is beyond the scope of module2's lesson.

**pm10 vs humidity**

We will adopt the same approach to investigate a possible relationship between humidity and concentration of the pm10 particles.

```{r}
mydata_bg %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = humidity, y = pm10)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2, shape = 20, col = "steelblue", size = 2) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F, col = "maroon3") + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = F, col = "limegreen") + 
  # give a title an label axes
  labs(title = "Humidity vs. pm10", 
       x = "humidity", y = "pm10.") + 
  
  # modify the appearance
  theme(legend.position = "none", 
        panel.border = element_rect(fill = NA, 
                                    colour = "black",
                                    size = .75),
        plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5))
```

As a challenge try to use a scatterplot to investigate a possible relationship between the concentration of the `p10` particles and the `temperature`.

**Happy R coding!!!** 😃🙌💜

**YOUR TURN 👇**

Using ‘athlete_events.csv’ file available from https://github.com/TanjaKec/RMarkdown4RR
(inside the `data` folder) create a RMarkdown report which will:

i)	Examine the structure of the data
ii)	Select variables that end with letter `t` and start with letter `S`
iii) Create Body Mass Index variable as $kg/m^2$ (hint: $BMI = Weight / (Height/100)^2$)
iv)	Filter from data: 
-	only Serbian teams and save it as `olympicSR`
-	only Serbian teams from 2000 onward and save it as `olympicSR21c`
athletes whose weight is bigger than 100kg and height is over 2m (hint: *Don't forget to use == instead of =! and Don't forget the quotes ""*)
v)	Arrange Serbian athletes in `olympicSR21c`data frame by Height in ascending and descending order.
vi)	Using olympicSR df
-	find the youngest athlete
-	find the heaviest athlete
vii)	Use `summarise()`:
-	to print out a summary of olypicSR df containing two variables: max_Age and max_BMI
-	to print out a summary of olypicSR df containing two variables: mean_Age and mean_BMI
viii)	Remember:

-	dplyr's  the `group_by()` function enables you to group your data. It allows you to create a separate df that splits the original df by a variable
-	Function `datatable()` from DT package enables you to display as table on HTML page an R data object that can be filtered, arranged etc

Knowing about the `group_by()` and `DT::datatable()` functions, find out number of medals for each of the exYU countrie team for 2016 olypic games?

-	visualise your finding!
